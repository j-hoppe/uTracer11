# uTracer11

„uTracer11“ (read: "micro-program-tracer for PDP-11") is a signal probe that is plugged into older UNIBUS PDP-11s.

The CPU state is visualized on a host PC via a graphical user interface (GUI)

It is primarily used for micro-stepping the CPU, as a function demo, repair tool, or for entertainment.
